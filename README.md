## My Notes

I have [attached](#) some more introductory notes into this repo for a couple portions of the curriculum. It should be a good starting point. It tries to incorporate general kubectl usage with the core concepts while diving a bit into specific topics. 

## Confidentiality Agreement

[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/certification/agreement/) has a confidentiality agreement for the CKA and CKAD, so please do not ask about any specific questions on the exam.
